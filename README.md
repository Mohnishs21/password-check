# password-check 
This code first checks the password length. If the password is less than 12 characters long, it prints an error message and returns False. Otherwise, it proceeds to check password complexity.
The code checks if the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit. If it doesn't, it prints an error message and returns False. Otherwise, it checks if the password contains at least one special character. If it doesn't, it prints an error message and returns False.
If the password passes all the checks, it prints a message saying that the password is strong and returns True.
You can further enhance this code by adding more checks, such as checking for common passwords or password patterns that are easy to guess.
